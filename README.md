# Medium Clone

Calling it a medium clone is an exaggeration, it's just a simple website where users can login using Google (login with email doesn't work) and can write stories (or blogs, I am just calling them stories).

This is my first intermediate level project, and it probably have many bugs and the code is very messy as well, if you have any suggestions, please let me know.

## How to run?
1. Create a new project in firebase.
2. Configure the web app by putting your firebase configs in the .env.local file.
3. Then simply run npm install && npm start in the terminal and this should work.
