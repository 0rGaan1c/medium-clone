# Medium Clone

Calling it a medium clone is an exaggeration, it's just a simple website where users can login using Google (login with email doesn't work) and can write stories (or blogs, I am just calling them stories).

## How to run?
1. Create a new project in firebase.
2. Configure the web app by putting your configs in the .env.local file.
