# Medium Clone

* Calling it a medium clone is an exaggeration, it's just a simple website where users can login using Google (login with email doesn't work) and can write stories (or blogs, I am just calling them stories).

## Tool Stack
* React
* Firebase
* TailwindCSS

[Live Demo](https://medium-clone-dev-e3730.web.app/)

## How to run?
1. Create a new project in firebase.
2. Configure the web app by putting your firebase configs in the .env.local file.
3. Then simply run npm install && npm start in the terminal and it should work.
